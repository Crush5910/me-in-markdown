## Introduction
I am Claire Rush, 10th grade. A funfact about myself is one I say quite frequently: I am 0% asian. 0 asian blood running in my veins. I don't really have any goals for the year. I want to get my manditory classes done so I can get to the classes that correspond to my hobbies, but that isn't for just this year. I don't have a foavorite food, but I do love pasta and japanese food. more specifically, creamy alfrado pasta with the multi-colored corkscrews with parmasean shreds on top...maybe I do have a favorite food.

During the summer I started a big creative project: making Pokemon cards. I've drawn around 25 artworks so far and have more on the way, the thing I really wanted was to hold them. During the summer I took 9 cards I made, printed them onto transparent paper, and glued them onto a sacrified holo card. Once I have more sacrifitial holos I can continue in making them. Until them, I'll just keep making more. 

During the summer I didn't do much. The first week was lazy, the month after that I was doing summer PE, then the three weeks after that were mostly lazy, hanging out with friends, or working on the project stated before. Even when I was hanging at my friend's house we were mostly not doing anything and just talking, drawing, and laughing at stupid jokes. yup, a good ol' lazy summer to get me ready for the school year.
